Raincloud
==========

CloudApp had some downtime, so I decided to implement an alternative endpoint for their API, so I can use their client, but have complete control over the data end.

Currently, only the "playback" of images in browser is supported, everything else gets a download page.

Requirements
-------------

    npm install express
    npm install jade
    npm install less
    npm install mongoose
